# machine-learning-workflow-exploration

## Overview

This repository explores a complete, end-to-end machine learning workflow. Starting from data loading and preprocessing, to model development, validation, evaluation, and visualization.
It follows a textbook-inspired, structured approach to demonstrate how I personally organize Machine Learning projects, making it useful both as a learning reference and as a foundation for future Machine Learning pipelines.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and other Machine Learning libraries
- Visualization tools such as matplotlib
- Exported HTML report for easy viewing without executing the notebook

## Contents & Objectives

This project demonstrates a typical Machine Learning workflow, including:
- Dataset loading and exploratory analysis
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Visualization of distributions and model behavior
- Model training and evaluation
- Saving and exporting model artifacts
- Producing a shareable, static HTML report

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

#### Engineering Enhancements
- Add a full CI/CD workflow for automated testing, linting, and notebook checks
- Refactor notebook code into modular Python scripts for better reusability

#### Deploying the model in a production-like setting
- Exploring deployment options such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or lightweight web apps (FastAPI/Flask).
- Experimenting with serverless inference or managed Machine Learning platforms

#### Containerization and environment automation
- Use Docker or Podman to build reproducible, isolated environments and streamline workflow automation.
